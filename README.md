It starts the quiz with the button after giving instructions, user finishes the quiz, in the console tab they can see if it is correct or not

f) Areas of improvement?

*my correct answers somehow all moved to c , they should be fixed.

*at the end of quiz there should be a submit button and a place to put name and then the quiz will display that in a list.

*my timer works awesome , it also subtracts 5 for each wrong , but it goes to negative times. 

*the shape of buttons look like text , they should be changed to a button looking text, but at least I already added the hover
